# Slowlane

Slowlane is a simple script that imitates a (what could be in the future)
ISP "package upgrade" page. This was made for the Battle for the Net July 12th
protest. It adapts to the user's ISP, if possible. ([demo!](https://tjhorner.com/slowlane/))

You can add it to your site like this:

```html
<script src="https://tjhorner.com/slowlane/widget.js" async></script>
```

The notice will display on July 12th, but you can test it by adding
`#slowlanedebug` to the end of your URL. It will also only display
once, and will never show again after the user clicks the "just take
me to the site I was going to" link
